						What's up fuckers I'm rickyG, an aspiring aerospace engineer driven by opportunities to learn and motivated by seeing progess. I graduated from UC Davis with a double major in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering as well as a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering. During my time as an undergraduate I was heavily involved in spacecraft design by taking part in and leading the REALOP CubeSat project. I am pictured on the left, just moments before a preliminary design review presentation during my time as the lead structures engineer. As a graduate student I joined the Energy Research Lab and conducted research on Hydrogen use in Hybrid Rocket propulsion.

						Taking from my experience, my fields of interest are propulsion, controls systems with an emphasis on spacecraft attitude determination and control systems, and systems engineering. I also have a personal interest in embedded systems and software development.
